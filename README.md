Welcome!

Before you can play the game, you will need to install the latest version of Python 3 and the pygame library.

Once you have done that, you can open Asterix.py. DO NOT edit the source code as this can damage the functionality of the game. And DO NOT open the other .py files as this could cause to program to stop working completely.

DO NOT open AllScores.txt as you may cause accidental data loss, causing the leader board aspect of the program stop working.

When you have opened Asterix.py, simply press F5 and you will be redirected to the program's main menu.

You simply use your mouse to navigate the main menu and click the appropriate button. Use the arrow keys to make the player move in that direction.

Other than that, have fun!
